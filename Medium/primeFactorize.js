/*
Write a program to find all the prime factors of a given number. The program must return an array containing all the prime factors, sorted in ascending order. Remember that 1 is neither prime nor composite and should not be included in your output array.

Examples
primeFactorize(25) ➞ [5, 5]

primeFactorize(19) ➞ [19]

primeFactorize(77) ➞ [7, 11]
Notes
Output array must be sorted in ascending order
The only positive integer which is neither prime nor composite is 1. Return an empty array if 1 is the input.
