/*
In a parallel universe, superheroes have a power level represented by a number.
Your task is to write a function that accepts an array of superheroes, 
each having a 'name' and 'powerLevel'. 

The function should return the name of the superhero who has the highest power level.
If more than one superhero has the same highest power level, return an array of their names.

Examples
getSuperHero([
  { name: "Superman", powerLevel: 100 },
  { name: "Batman", powerLevel: 85 },
  { name: "Spiderman", powerLevel: 120 }
])
➞ "Spiderman"

getSuperHero([
  { name: "Flash", powerLevel: 200 },
  { name: "Hulk", powerLevel: 200 },
  { name: "Thor", powerLevel: 150 }
])
➞ ["Flash", "Hulk"]

function getSuperHero(heroes) {

}
