/*
Create a function that finds all elements in the given array, such that each element is greater than all elements to the right of it.
If there is no number to the right, that element should be returned too.

Examples
leader([2, 3, 20, 15, 8, 3]) ➞ [20, 15, 8, 3]
// Note that, 20 is greater than all the elements to it's
// right side, similarly 15 and so on.

leader([2, 3, 20, 15, 8, 25, 3]) ➞ [25, 3]
// Note that, 20 cannot be added because 25 is present,
// which is greater than 20.

leader([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ [5]
Notes
Add elements in the new array in the same way they occur in the input array.
