# Interview Questions

Hi! This repo is made for you to practice your coding interview skills. For some challenges you will need to research new methods.
Solutions are provided as a guidance and only for reference after trying to solve it by yourself.

How to use it:

- Check that you have the latest LTS Node version installed. To do that, open a terminal/cmd window and run:
node --version
If it doesn't retrieve you the current version please go to <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> and download the latest LTS version (not current).
- Clone the repo to your projects / dev folder
- Run the command in the terminal : 'npm install'
- Start writing your code in the proper files.
- To run a test for a specific exercise do `npm run test-{filename}`:

```bash
npm run test-arrayOfMultiples
```

or to run all tests together

```bash
npm run test
```

## Happy coding!
